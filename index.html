            <h1> Have you ever felt like you needed to make a conscious effort to change? </h1> 
            <br><br>
            I don't think I did a full 180 from where I was in my teens, but I know there were decisions I was making then that made me happier. I was reading my scriptures daily because I had seminary. I was taking notes in church and during general conference. Some of these are harder to do with kids, so it takes a really conscious effort for me to do. I started this website to help keep me accountable to focusing on the Lord. I wanted somewhere physical to see my progress.

            <br><br>

            I have a testimony of the idea that the Lord always creates way so that we can follow him. That does not mean we won't have obstacles on our path, but there is always a way around them. I know we are blessed as we "go and do." I hope that I can create a space here where you can gain some motivation to look past the trials and continue growing closer to the Lord.
